# About

I’m 16 years old and focused on becoming a Red Teamer.

I specialize in **web and network penetration testing**, with hands-on experience in:
- Active Directory Exploitation  
- Network Penetration Testing
- Web App Penetration Testing  

I use **Python** to automate reconnaissance and testing tasks, and I continuously improve my skills through labs, CTFs, and realistic attack simulations.
